# v0.4.0

The first release candidate for Ignite's biggest release yet!

There are many significant changes compared to before:

## New Features

 - Make base and kernel OCI images composable for a VM. You can now choose what kernel to combine with what base image freely https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/pull/105
 - Add the GitOps mode for Ignite using `ignite gitops` https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/pull/100
   - Documentation: https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/blob/master/gitops
 - Make it possible to run `ignite create` and `ignite run` declaratively https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/commit/57333646b52a0e1e3a725340e994b2749b39e5bd
   - Documentation: https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/blob/master/docs/declarative-config.md
 - Added Prometheus metrics for `ignite-spawn` https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/commit/94abc529972873db3fa3ee954099a4f62d67b6f3
   - Documentation: https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/blob/master/docs/prometheus.md
 - Implemented CNI support https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/commit/a8897532f9f6a8f5c40025f0f93ab2d24f2c7cd3

## API Machinery

 - Added the `ignite.weave.works/v1alpha1` API group with the Ignite API types https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/commit/ca1edc8e7a61b950811c6145ba2ad53f8cdc2a04
   - API reference: https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/blob/master/api/ignite.md
   - This API version will not change in a future version. When improvements are made, it will be to `v1alpha2` etc.
 - Add a meta API package containing supporting but generic API types for Ignite https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/commit/09d51abd409ee361e93884baae24ffc92cde63a9
   - API reference: https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/blob/master/api/meta.md
 - Create composable interfaces for the internal API machinery: `Client` -> `Cache` -> `Storage` -> `RawStorage` -> `Serializer` https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/pull/93 https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/pull/96 https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/pull/99
 - The API Machinery used in Ignite is partly based on the Kubernetes API machinery (`k8s.io/apimachinery`), and hence follows some of the same patterns

## New Commands

 - Add the `ignite inspect` command https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/pull/107
 - Add the `ignite gitops` command https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/pull/100

   - See: https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/blob/master/api/openapi/openapi_generated.go
 - Add API type documentation https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/commit/218c94723f836b8e2cb82886b8664544933ea605
   - See: https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/blob/master/api
 - Added architecture diagram https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/commit/da53f9fc2f5790edacb5d1b541dd4da8a6089673
