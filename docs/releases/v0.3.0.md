## v0.3.0

Major release with significant UX and internal improvements:

 - There is no longer a difference between an Ignite image and an OCI image, this is now the same thing.
     - Ignite operates on OCI images directly, for both OS images and kernels. The kernel is expected to be coupled with the image given to `ignite run`, in `/boot/vmlinux`.
 - It is now possible to do `ignite run [OCI image]` directly, and everything (e.g. pulling the image) is handled automatically. e.g. `ignite run -i weaveworks/ignite-ubuntu`.
 - Now `ignite images` shows OCI images that are cached and ready to use, and `ignite kernels` the kernels already imported from base images.
 - Added an example usage guide for running a Kubernetes cluster in HA mode using kubeadm and Ignite.
 - Removed `ignite build`, and `ignite image/kernel import`; as these are no longer needed
 - Importing an image from a tROADMAPar file is no longer possible, package the contents in an OCI image instead
 - Added a new command `ignite ssh [vm]` and flag: `ignite run --ssh`. This allows for automatic SSH logins.
 - Now Ignite logs user-friendly messages by default. To get machine-readable output, use the `--quiet` flag.
 - Ignite now requires the user to be `root`. This will be revisited later, when the architecture has changed.
 - The command outputs and structure is now more user-friendly.
 - Fixed several bugs both under the hood, and user-affecting ones
