# v0.2.0

Major release with significant improvements

 - Ignite is now using `devicemapper` under the hood, for overlay snapshots for filesystem writes, allowing for image reuse, efficient use of space and way faster builds!
 - Added sample Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS 7 OS images & a 4.19 kernel build
 - Automatic network configuration, now the OS image doesn't need to enable DHCP, as that is done in the kernel
 - Automatically populate `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf`, too
 - Add an option to bind a port exposed by the VM to a host port (`ignite run -p 80:80`)
 - Add an option for modifying the kernel command line (`ignite run --kernel-args`)
 - Add an option to copy files from the host into the VM (`ignite run --copy-files`)
 - Add an option to specify the amount of cores, RAM, and overlay size (`ignite run --cpus 2 --memory 1024 --size 4GB`)
 - Removed the need for the Ignite container to run with `--privileged`
 - Allow for force-deletions of images, kernels and vms.
 - Added documentation.
 - Moved repo from `luxas/ignite` to `weaveworks/ignite`
