## ignite kernel rm

Remove kernels

### Synopsis


Remove one or multiple VM kernels. Kernels are matched by prefix based on their
ID and name. To remove multiple kernels, chain the matches separated by spaces.
The force flag (-f, --force) kills and removes any running VMs using the kernel.


```
ignite kernel rm <kernel>... [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -f, --force   Force this operation. Warning, use of this mode may have unintended consequences.
  -h, --help    help for rm
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -q, --quiet   The quiet mode allows for machine-parsable output, by printing only IDs
```
