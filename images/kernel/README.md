# Kernel Images

These kernel OCI images contain the kernel binary (at `/boot/vmlinux`) and supporting modules (in `/lib/modules`)
for guest VMs ran by Ignite.

## Building the Kernel Images

```console
$ make
```

## Versions

All LTS versions starting from 4.14 and above are supported by the Ignite team.
This means in practice:

- 4.14.x
- 4.19.x
- 5.4.x

The exact patch versions may be found in the [Makefile](Makefile).
The available versions exist in the [stable kernel git tree](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/refs/).

## Upgrading to a new kernel version

The kernel Makefile has an `upgrade` command that will generate patched kernel configs for each specific version in `KERNEL_VERSIONS`.

The linux kernel source code is checked out in a build container for each target version, and a resulting "olddefconfig" based on each Firecracker recommended base-config in the `upstream/` directory is then output to the `versioned/` directory.

Once `make upgrade-%` has produced a firecracker base-config for all `KERNEL_VERSIONS`, the resulting versioned configs are copied to the `generated/` dir and are patched with ignite specific `./config-patches`. These configs under `generated/` are used for the matching kernel builds.

Run:

```console
$ make upgrade
```

after you've upgraded the values in the Makefile.

## Kernel Config Parameters we care about

Some options to the kernel are specifically important for making guest software work.

Please see: [config-patches](config-patches) for what kernel configs we've changed.
The base kernel config is the MicroVM-optimized config file from the Firecracker team.
We're storing it in [upstream/config-amd64](upstream/config-amd64). It's available online
at [firecracker/resources](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/tree/main/resources).
