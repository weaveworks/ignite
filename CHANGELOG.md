## v0.6.1

**Released:** 02/10/2019

We're excited to release `v0.6.1` with usability improvements and lots of bug fixes :)

This release consists of **32** noteworthy PRs from 6 contributors over the past month.  
We had **7** contributions from 4 external contributors. Thanks so much!

Ignite should now work with most installations of containerd -- even those that are installed underneath upstream docker.  
Care has been taken with our installation instructions to ensure we are not breaking users docker installations.  
We've also implemented a graceful fallback to older containerd-shim versions and now support containerd-shim-runc-v2.  

This release also contains numerous fixes that make the CNI network plugin work much more reliably.  
Connections to the internet from vm's using CNI should now work on most machines by default.  
Please see the following user-facing change.  

### Default CNI Network Change

The default `cni0` bridge has changed to a new `ignite0` bridge introduced by the [#460](https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/pull/460) bugfix. This comes with a new subnet as well.  
We did this because the default CNI config shipped in `v0.6.0` was a non-working configuration for most users.  
You may continue to use the default CNI configuration. Nothing will change automatically.  

If you are using your own CNI configuration, this does not affect you.

To migrate your running CNI networked vm's to the new default subnet, you can:
1. install this new ignite version
2. stop the relevant vm's
3. delete the CNI network
4. restart them

Example:
```bash
# first, upgrade to ignite v0.6.1

# list all vm's on the default 172.18.0.0/16 CNI network
sudo bin/ignite vm ls | grep '\b172.18.[0-9][0-9]*.[0-9][0-9]*\b'
# stop the listed vm's with the appropriate runtime
sudo bin/ignite stop my-containerd-vm
sudo bin/ignite stop my-docker-vm --runtime docker

# remove the old CNI network config
sudo rm -rf rm /etc/cni/net.d/
# optional: remove the old bridge
sudo ifconfig cni0 down
sudo ip link delete cni0

# restart your vm's
sudo bin/ignite start my-containerd-vm
sudo bin/ignite start my-docker-vm --runtime docker
# Your vm's will now have addresses configured in the 10.61.0.0/16 subnet.
# If they did not have internet connectivity before, they now should.
```

## v0.6.0

**Released:** 30/08/2019

Welcome to the `v0.6.0` release, consisting of major underlying improvements, and a more efficient runtime.

This release consists of **25** noteworthy PRs from 4 contributors; although v0.5.0 was released just two weeks ago!
We had **5** contributions from 2 external contributors, thanks :tada:!

The main themes of this release has been:

- **containerd** is now used as the default container runtime for higher security and speed, and less resource usage
  - This means that Ignite doesn't depend on `docker` anymore!
- **CNI** is now the default networking plugin; by default the `bridge` and `portmap` plugins are used
  - You can still use your third-party CNI implementation of choice, see [the networking doc](https://ignite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/networking.html)
- **GitOps Toolkit** refactor is complete; now everything you need to create your Git-backed application is available at **https://github.com/weaveworks/gitops-toolkit**
  - Ignite is using this toolkit internally to perform its GitOps capabilities, now you can easily use this functionality, too!

## v0.5.0

**Released:** 13/08/2019

This release consists of **54** noteworthy PRs from 12 contributors.
We had **14** contributions from 8 external contributors, thanks :tada:!

The main themes of this release has been:

### API Machinery

 - Added the `ignite.weave.works/v1alpha1` API group with the Ignite API types https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/commit/ca1edc8e7a61b950811c6145ba2ad53f8cdc2a04
   - API reference: https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/blob/master/api/ignite.md
   - This API version will not change in a future version. When improvements are made, it will be to `v1alpha2` etc.
 - Add a meta API package containing supporting but generic API types for Ignite https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/commit/09d51abd409ee361e93884baae24ffc92cde63a9
   - API reference: https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/blob/master/api/meta.md
 - Create composable interfaces for the internal API machinery: `Client` -> `Cache` -> `Storage` -> `RawStorage` -> `Serializer` https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/pull/93 https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/pull/96 https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/pull/99
 - The API Machinery used in Ignite is partly based on the Kubernetes API machinery (`k8s.io/apimachinery`), and hence follows some of the same patterns

## v0.3.0

**Released:** 18/06/2019

## Major release with significant UX and internal improvements:

 - There is no longer a difference between an Ignite image and an OCI image, this is now the same thing.
     - Ignite operates on OCI images directly, for both OS images and kernels. The kernel is expected to be coupled with the image given to `ignite run`, in `/boot/vmlinux`.
 - It is now possible to do `ignite run [OCI image]` directly, and everything (e.g. pulling the image) is handled automatically. e.g. `ignite run -i weaveworks/ignite-ubuntu`.
 - Now `ignite images` shows OCI images that are cached and ready to use, and `ignite kernels` the kernels already imported from base images.
 - Added an example usage guide for running a Kubernetes cluster in HA mode using kubeadm and Ignite.
 - Removed `ignite build`, and `ignite image/kernel import`; as these are no longer needed
 - Importing an image from a tar file is no longer possible, package the contents in an OCI image instead
 - Added a new command `ignite ssh [vm]` and flag: `ignite run --ssh`. This allows for automatic SSH logins.
 - Now Ignite logs user-friendly messages by default. To get machine-readable output, use the `--quiet` flag.
 - Ignite now requires the user to be `root`. This will be revisited later, when the architecture has changed.
 - The command outputs and structure is now more user-friendly.
 - Fixed several bugs both under the hood, and user-affecting ones


---

## v0.2.0

**Released:** 06/06/2019

## Major release with significant improvements

 - Ignite is now using `devicemapper` under the hood, for overlay snapshots for filesystem writes, allowing for image reuse, efficient use of space and way faster builds!
 - Added sample Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS 7 OS images & a 4.19 kernel build
 - Automatic network configuration, now the OS image doesn't need to enable DHCP, as that is done in the kernel
 - Automatically populate `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf`, too
 - Add an option to bind a port exposed by the VM to a host port (`ignite run -p 80:80`)
 - Add an option for modifying the kernel command line (`ignite run --kernel-args`)
 - Add an option to copy files from the host into the VM (`ignite run --copy-files`)
 - Add an option to specify the amount of cores, RAM, and overlay size (`ignite run --cpus 2 --memory 1024 --size 4GB`)
 - Removed the need for the Ignite container to run with `--privileged`
 - Allow for force-deletions of images, kernels and vms.
 - Added documentation.
 - Moved repo from luxas/ignite to weaveworks/ignite

### Use it
