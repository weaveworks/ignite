### Introduction

[Weave Ignite](https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite) is a tool for managing vm in the container way. This is a great open source project, but it seems [dead](https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite/issues/971) now. I want someone could help save this project.

### Status

There are just one member now, i am working with understanding the code.
